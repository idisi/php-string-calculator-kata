A starting point, using PHP, for the String Calculator Kata - http://nimblepros.com/media/36628/string%20calculator%20kata.pdf by Roy Osherove - @RoyOsherove

Kata steps (summary)

1. Create a String calculator with a method int Add(string numbers).
  The method can take 0, 1, or 2 numbers and will return their sum.
  An empty string will return 0.
  Example inputs: "", "1", or "1,2"

2. Allow the Add method to handle an unknown number of arguments/numbers.

3. Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).
  Example: "1\n2,3" should return 6.
  Example: "1,\n" is invalid, but you donâ€™t need a test for this case.

4. Allow the Add method to handle a different delimiter:
  To change the delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: "//[delimiter]\n[numbers]"
  Example: "//;\n1;2" should return 3 (the delimiter is ;)
  This first line is optional; all existing scenarios (using , or \n) should work as before.

5. Calling Add with a negative number will throw an exception "Negatives not allowed: " listing all negative numbers that were in the list of numbers.
  Example "-1,2" throws "Negatives not allowed: -1"
  Example "2,-4,3,-5" throws "Negatives not allowed: -4,-5"

6. Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored.
  Example: "1001,2" returns 2.

7. Delimiters can be of any length, using this syntax: "//[***]\n1***2***3" returns 6.

8. Allow multiple delimiters, using this syntax: "//[*][%]\n1*2%3" returns 6.

9. Handle multiple delimiters of any length.

Tests can be run with PHPUnit - https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/
